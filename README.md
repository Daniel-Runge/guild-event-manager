# guild-event-manager
The Guild Event Manager (GEM) is a small project to manage guild events for Never Ever Again on Silvermoon.

The goals for the project are as follows 

- [ ] Simple webapp for creating events and signing up, similar to events managed through, for example, Google Forms
- [ ] Basic Discord integration, either as a webhook or a discord bot service to advertise for coming events
- [ ] WoW addon to handle invites and maybe ingame management of the guild
